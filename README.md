# Airbnb Experiences Clone

## Objective
The objective of this project is to develop an app with static and reusable **data-driven React components**, practicing the fundamental setup and structure of a React project. This project was built following the **"Learn React for Free"** course by Bob Ziroll on Scrimba.

## Structure
The app consists of four main components:
- **Navbar**: The navigation bar at the top of the page.
- **Hero**: A static component displaying the main content.
- **Card**: A reusable, data-driven component that dynamically displays experience details.
- **Footer**: A simple footer that displays a brief attribution and includes a hyperlink to the developer's personal portfolio.

## Tools and Technologies Used
- **Vite**: For fast and modern development tooling. Vite was used to set up the project and streamline development, replacing Create React App.
  - For more details on Vite, check out the [documentation here](https://vitejs.dev/guide/).
  
- **Figma**: The design of the app was inspired by a Figma design file. Figma is a powerful tool for design collaboration.

## Key Learnings
- **React Syntax**: Gained an understanding of JSX and React component structure.
- **Using Vite**: Learned how to set up a fast development environment to improve productivity.
- **Mapping Data**: Used the `.map()` method to render multiple components dynamically.
- **Key Prop**: Understood the importance of the `key` prop for optimizing rendering in React.
- **Props in React**:
  - Receiving props in a component.
  - Destructuring props for cleaner code.
  - Passing non-string props.
  - Passing an object as props vs. spreading an objectâ€™s properties as props.
